## Definition

Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

## Example
### Social media login process

In this example we simulate different way to login to social media depending on user choice.
* Example "AbstractClass" is called Network
* Concrete classes are Facebook and Twitter
* We're simulating the following steps
  * LogIn
  * SendMessage
  * LogOut
